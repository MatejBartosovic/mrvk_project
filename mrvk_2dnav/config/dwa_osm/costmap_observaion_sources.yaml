  observation_persistence: 5 #How long to keep each sensor reading in seconds. A value of 0.0 will only keep the most recent reading.
  expected_update_rate: 0.5 #How often to expect a reading from a sensor in seconds. A value of 0.0 will allow infinite time between readings. This parameter is used as a failsafe to keep the navigation stack from commanding the robot when a sensor has failed. It should be set to a value that is slightly more permissive than the actual rate of the sensor. For example, if we expect a scan from a laser every 0.05 seconds we might set this parameter to be 0.1 seconds to give a generous buffer and account for some amount of system latency.
